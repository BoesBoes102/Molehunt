# Molehunt

A Minecraft server plugin that adds an Among Us-style multiplayer game mode to your server!

## 📖 Overview

Molehunt is a social deduction game where players are randomly assigned roles at the start of each game.

**Innocents** win by either:
- Defeating the dragon boss
- Eliminating all moles

**Moles** win by:
- Killing all innocents before they achieve their objectives
- Preventing the dragon from being defeated

A grace period at the start protects players, then the world border begins shrinking, creating pressure and forcing encounters.
